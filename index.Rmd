# Sykdomspulsen Core in Depth {.unnumbered}

Sykdomspulsen Core is the free and open-source backbone of [Sykdomspulsen](https://docs.sykdomspulsen.no).

Sykdomspulsen Core is a standalone R package, which means it is easy for other teams to build up their own surveillance infrastructure based on Sykdomspulsen Core.
